Notes on the QT support in libodbc++:

The QT "support" means simply that std::string becomes QString,
std::istream becomes QIODevice and odbc::Bytes becomes QByteArray.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Date, Time and Timestamp are not mapped to QDate, QTime and QDateTime;
QDateTime's resolution is seconds, which is not enough for an SQL
TIMESTAMP.

For installation instructions, see doc/INSTALL/index.html.
